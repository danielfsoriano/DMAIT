TO ALLOW DMAIT FRAMEWORK TO WORK IT IS NECESSARY TO MODIFY THE FILE 
/contiki-ng/os/net/routing/rpl-mrhof.c

THIS MODIFICATION ADDS A NEGATIVE LIST MODIFICATION TO RPL SO IT DOES NOT ACCEPT A NODE IN THE NEGATIVE LIST AS A VIABLE PARENT.

PLEASE REPLACE THE "rpl-mrhof.c" file with the file here to allow that.
